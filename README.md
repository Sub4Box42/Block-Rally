Block Rally is a minimalist game created with the pygame library in python.

How to install: Download the files as a zip file, extract it in file explorer, and if it detects a virus, have it run anyway. I tested the game myself and I assure you there are no viruses.

Compiled with pyinstaller, created by Jimmy Logan.
